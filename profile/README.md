# ForSaken Borders
ForSaken Borders aims to be a whole ecosystem of technology. We currently believe that a large part of the internet is sealed off only to those who have the required money. Money is a huge factor, affecting the quality of the user's experience. We believe that everyone's experience should be the same, regardless of money or status. That's how ForSaken Borders was made, and that's the goal kept in mind when making our services.
